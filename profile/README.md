## Introduction
I am a 23 year old college student who is currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering. I enjoy writing content libraries because of how intuitive Avrae is and how I can make the lives of users easier with quality automation.

While I do this for free, taking the time to donate a few dollars allows me to dedicate more time to these projects as I have a family that I have to help take care of on top of schooling and work.
